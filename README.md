This repository consists of the various variable files, R Scripts abd R Markdown Script.

Project Description:

The submission for the choose-your-own project will be three files: a report in the form of both a PDF document and Rmd file and the R script that performs your machine learning task. You must also provide access to your dataset, either through automatic download in your script or inclusion in a GitHub repository. (Remember, you are strongly discouraged from using well-known datasets, particularly ones that have been used as examples in previous courses or are similar to them.) We recommend submitting a link to a GitHub repository with these three files and your dataset. Your grade for the project will be based on your report and your script.
